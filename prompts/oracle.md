description: Prepare and dispatch a ChatGPT web oracle job
---
You are preparing an /oracle job.

Do not answer the user's request directly yet.

Required workflow:
1. Understand the request.
2. Gather repo context first by reading files and searching the codebase.
3. Choose archive inputs for the oracle job.
4. Craft a concise but complete oracle prompt for ChatGPT web.
5. Call oracle_submit with the prompt and exact archive inputs.
6. Stop immediately after dispatching the oracle job.

Oracle model (`oracle_submit`):
- To choose a specific ChatGPT model, pass **`preset`** with one of the allowed ids from the canonical preset registry.
- Matching human-readable preset labels and common hyphen/space variants are also accepted and normalized automatically, but prefer canonical ids when readily available.
- **Or** omit **`preset`** entirely to use the configured default model (from oracle config).
- **`preset`** is the only model-selection parameter on `oracle_submit`. Do not pass `modelFamily`, `effort`, or `autoSwitchToThinking`.
- If unsure which preset fits the task, ask the user.

Rules:
- Always include an archive. Do not submit without context files.
- By default, include the whole repository by passing `.`. Default archive exclusions apply automatically, including common bulky outputs and obvious credentials/private data like `.env` files, key material, credential dotfiles, local database files, and root `secrets/` directories.
- Only limit file selection if the user explicitly requests it, if the task is clearly scoped to a smaller area, or if privacy/sensitivity requires it.
- For very targeted asks like reviewing one function or explaining one stack trace, a smaller archive is preferable.
- If the request depends on git state or pending changes (for example code review, ship readiness, or release approval), create a tracked diff bundle file inside the repo (for example under `.pi/`) containing `git status` plus `git diff` output, include that file in the archive, and tell the oracle to use it because the `.git` directory is not included in oracle exports.
- When `files=["."]` and the post-exclusion archive is still too large, submit automatically prunes the largest nested directories matching generic generated-output names like `build/`, `dist/`, `out/`, `coverage/`, and `tmp/` outside obvious source roots like `src/` and `lib/` until the archive fits or no candidate remains. Successful submissions report what was pruned.
- If a submitted oracle job later fails because upload is rejected, retry with a smaller archive in this order: (1) remove the largest obviously irrelevant/generated content, (2) if still too large, include modified files plus adjacent files plus directly relevant subtrees, (3) if still too large, explain the cut or ask the user.
- Prefer the configured default (omit **`preset`**) unless the task clearly needs a different model; then choose a canonical **`preset`** id.
- If `oracle_submit` itself fails because the local archive still exceeds the upload limit after default exclusions and automatic generic generated-output-dir pruning, or for any other submit-time error, stop and report the error. Do not retry automatically.
- If `oracle_submit` returns a queued job instead of an immediately dispatched one, treat that as success and end your turn exactly the same way.
- After oracle_submit returns, end your turn. Do not keep working while the oracle runs.
