# pi-oracle

`pi-oracle` is a `pi` package that lets the agent hand off difficult, long-running tasks to ChatGPT.com through the web app instead of the API.

Use it when you want:
- your real ChatGPT account
- web-model behavior instead of API usage
- large repo/context uploads
- async background execution
- durable saved responses/artifacts plus best-effort wake-ups back into `pi`

Normal oracle jobs run in an isolated browser profile, not your active Chrome window.

> Status: experimental public beta. This fork is intended to work on macOS and WSL/Linux with Google Chrome and `pi` 0.65.0+.

## When to use it

Use `pi-oracle` for:
- big code reviews of a repo or pending changes
- architectural or migration analysis that benefits from a large uploaded archive
- long-running prompts that may take minutes to finish
- follow-up questions in the same ChatGPT thread later

Do not reach for it first for:
- normal short coding tasks that `pi` can handle directly
- workflows that must never upload project archives to ChatGPT.com
- environments outside the current supported setup

## Install

npm:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-oracle
```

GitHub:

```bash
pi install https://github.com/huynguyendinhquang/pi-oracle
```

## Quickstart

1. Start a normal persisted `pi` session. Do not use `pi --no-session` for oracle.
2. Make sure ChatGPT already works in your local Chrome profile. On WSL, use Google Chrome inside WSL rather than Windows Chrome.
3. Make sure these are installed: Google Chrome, `agent-browser`, `tar`, and `zstd`.
4. Optional: create `~/.pi/agent/extensions/oracle.json` if you want non-default settings.
5. Run `/oracle-auth`. If cookie import is unavailable, it can fall back to a one-time manual login in the isolated oracle auth browser.
6. Run `/oracle Review the current pending changes. Include the whole repo unless a narrower archive is clearly better.`
7. Wait for a best-effort wake-up, or check `/oracle-status`.

The `/oracle` prompt now runs an early oracle preflight before it gathers repo context, so missing persisted-session or local auth/config blockers fail before the agent spends time reading files.

For explicitly narrow requests, `/oracle` should still prefer a context-rich relevant archive up to the 250 MB ceiling, including nearby tests, docs, config, and adjacent modules when that can improve answer quality. Reserve tightly minimal archives for an explicit user request for a tight archive, privacy-sensitive material, or size-constrained cases. It should also omit `preset` and use the configured default model unless the task clearly needs a different one.

If a local archive still exceeds the 250 MB limit after default exclusions and automatic whole-repo pruning, the agent should treat that as a retryable archive-selection failure: shrink the archive automatically, retry with a smaller relevant slice, and explain what it cut only if it still cannot fit after the allowed retry budget.

If you miss the wake-up, the result is still saved durably in the oracle job directory and can be read later.

## Example requests

```text
/oracle Review the current pending changes. Include the whole repo unless a narrower archive is clearly better. Give me a prioritized code review with concrete fixes.
```

```text
/oracle Read the codebase and explain the highest-risk auth/session failure modes, including what to test before shipping.
```

```text
/oracle Explain the README guidance for /oracle-clean retention grace. Archive README.md plus any nearby docs or implementation files that help answer accurately.
```

```text
/oracle-followup <job-id> Tighten the migration plan around rollback risk, and include the most relevant surrounding files/docs as long as the archive stays comfortably within the limit.
```

After a job finishes, use `/oracle-followup <job-id> <request>` to continue the same ChatGPT thread without hand-writing the low-level `followUpJobId` tool parameter.

## High-level flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["/oracle request"] --> B["Agent preflights, then gathers a context-rich relevant repo slice"]
    B --> C["oracle_submit builds archive"]
    C --> D["Detached worker starts isolated ChatGPT runtime"]
    D --> E["Archive + prompt sent to ChatGPT.com"]
    E --> F["Response/artifacts saved under oracle job dir"]
    F --> G["Best-effort wake-up to matching pi session"]
```

If concurrency is full, the job is queued and starts automatically later.

## What the package adds

User-facing commands:
- `/oracle <request>` — prompt template that tells the agent to gather context and dispatch an oracle job
- `/oracle-followup <job-id> <request>` — prompt template that continues an earlier oracle job in the same ChatGPT thread
- `/oracle-auth` — sync ChatGPT cookies from your configured Chrome profile into the isolated oracle auth profile, with a manual-login fallback when cookie import is unavailable
- `/oracle-read [job-id]` — inspect job status plus the saved response preview
- `/oracle-status [job-id]` — inspect job status and list recent job ids when no explicit id is given
- `/oracle-cancel <job-id>` — cancel a queued or active job by id
- `/oracle-clean <job-id|all>` — remove temp files for terminal jobs; recently woken terminal jobs may stay retained briefly and return a retry-after hint

Agent-facing tools:
- `oracle_preflight`
- `oracle_auth`
- `oracle_submit`
- `oracle_read`
- `oracle_cancel`

## Minimal config

Most users can start with the packaged defaults and only set the Chrome profile if needed.

`~/.pi/agent/extensions/oracle.json`

```json
{
  "defaults": {
    "preset": "<preset id from ORACLE_SUBMIT_PRESETS>"
  },
  "auth": {
    "chromeProfile": "Default"
  }
}
```

Notes:
- `defaults.preset` is the default ChatGPT model preset for oracle jobs.
- The canonical preset ids live in `extensions/oracle/lib/config.ts`.
- If the packaged default is fine, you can omit `defaults.preset` entirely.
- You usually do not need to set browser paths unless auto-detection fails.

## Available presets

| Preset id | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pro_standard` | Pro - Standard |
| `pro_extended` | Pro - Extended |
| `thinking_light` | Thinking - Light |
| `thinking_standard` | Thinking - Standard |
| `thinking_extended` | Thinking - Extended |
| `thinking_heavy` | Thinking - Heavy |
| `instant` | Instant |
| `instant_auto_switch` | Instant - Auto-switch to Thinking Enabled |

`oracle_submit` accepts either the canonical preset id or the matching human-readable preset label; common space/hyphen variants are normalized automatically at submit time. Keep `defaults.preset` in config on the canonical preset id.

Other useful settings:
- `browser.runMode`
- `browser.args`
- `browser.authSeedProfileDir`
- `browser.runtimeProfilesDir`
- `cleanup.completeJobRetentionMs`
- `cleanup.failedJobRetentionMs`

Project config should only override safe, non-privileged settings.

## What happens to outputs

- Jobs persist their response and any artifacts under `${PI_ORACLE_JOBS_DIR:-/tmp}/oracle-<job-id>/` by default.
- Jobs can queue automatically if runtime capacity is full.
- Completion delivery into `pi` is best-effort wake-up based.
- If you miss the wake-up, use `/oracle-read [job-id]` to inspect the saved response preview.
- `/oracle-status [job-id]` still shows saved job metadata and lists recent job ids when you omit the id.
- Agent callers can use `oracle_read({ jobId })`.
- If a prior oracle run failed because ChatGPT login was required or the worker explicitly said to rerun `/oracle-auth`, agent callers can run `oracle_auth({})` once and then retry the submission once.
- `/oracle-clean` can still refuse a terminal job briefly after a wake-up send so saved response/artifact paths survive the follow-up turn; when that guard applies, it returns the next eligible cleanup time.

## Requirements

- macOS or WSL/Linux
- Node.js 22 or newer
- Google Chrome installed
- ChatGPT already signed into a local Chrome profile
- `pi` 0.65.0 or newer
- `agent-browser` available on the machine
- `tar` and `zstd` available

## Troubleshooting

### `/oracle-auth` fails or says login is required

- Make sure ChatGPT works in the same local Chrome profile you configured.
- Re-run `/oracle-auth`.
- If cookie import is unavailable, complete the one-time manual login in the isolated auth browser when it opens.
- If ChatGPT is half-logged-in or challenge flow state looks weird, finish the login/challenge in the headed auth browser and retry.

### You hit a challenge / verification page

- Solve it in the headed oracle browser if prompted.
- On WSL, oracle now defaults to headed Chrome to reduce Cloudflare/login churn; leave that browser open long enough to finish any visible challenge.
- Then re-run `/oracle-auth` before submitting jobs again.
### You see "Oracle requires a persisted pi session"

- Do not run oracle from `pi --no-session`.
- Start a normal persisted `pi` session, then use `/oracle` again.

### A job finished but no wake-up arrived

- Use `/oracle-read [job-id]` to inspect the saved response preview.
- Use `/oracle-status [job-id]` when you want status metadata or need help finding a job id.
- Agent callers can use `oracle_read({ jobId })` if they need tool output in the current turn.
- Results are still saved on disk even if the reminder turn does not land.

### `/oracle-clean` refuses a terminal job right after completion

- This can happen during the short post-send retention grace window after a wake-up was sent.
- The command now returns a `Retry after ...` timestamp when that guard is active.
- Wait until that time, then rerun `/oracle-clean [job-id|all]`.

### `agent-browser`, `tar`, or `zstd` is missing

- Install the missing local dependency and rerun the command.

### Auto-detection picked the wrong Chrome profile

- Set `auth.chromeProfile` in `~/.pi/agent/extensions/oracle.json`.
- Re-run `/oracle-auth`.

### You want more details about a failed run

- Inspect the job directory under `${PI_ORACLE_JOBS_DIR:-/tmp}/oracle-<job-id>/`.
- The worker log and captured diagnostics are stored there.

- `docs/ORACLE_RECOVERY_DRILL.md` — safe expired-auth recovery validation drill
- `docs/ORACLE_ISOLATED_PI_VALIDATION.md` — repeatable isolated `pi` session smoke test for local-extension validation

## Privacy / local data

This extension is local-first, but it does read and persist local data:
- `/oracle-auth` reads ChatGPT cookies from a local Chrome profile
- job archives are uploaded to ChatGPT.com
- responses and artifacts are written under the configured oracle jobs dir

Review the code and design docs before using it with sensitive material.

## Validation helpers

```bash
npm run check:oracle-extension
npm run typecheck
npm run typecheck:worker-helpers
npm run sanity:oracle
npm run pack:check
# conventional local gate
npm test
# or all at once
npm run verify:oracle
```

`npm publish` is also guarded locally via `prepublishOnly` and will run `npm run verify:oracle` before publishing.

## Beta caveats

The highest-risk areas to monitor are:
- ChatGPT UI drift
- auth/bootstrap drift
- artifact download behavior
- local environment assumptions
